# Setting Up Permanent Hosting with Binance API Integration

Let's set up permanent hosting for your trading signals page with real Binance API integration. I'll focus on using free hosting options and implementing the Binance API authentication without user accounts.

## Step 1: Create a Binance API Key

First, you'll need to create API keys from your Binance account:

1. Log in to your Binance account
2. Go to "API Management" (usually found under your profile)
3. Create a new API key
4. For security, set these restrictions:
   - Enable reading permissions only
   - Restrict access to specific IP addresses if possible
   - Disable withdrawals

**Important security note:** Never share your API Secret Key with anyone, and don't commit it to public repositories.

## Step 2: Prepare the Project for Deployment

I'll modify our code to securely use the Binance API keys. We'll use environment variables to store sensitive information.

## Step 3: Deploy to Netlify (Free Hosting)

Netlify offers free hosting for static sites with some serverless functions capability, which is perfect for our needs.

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

We'll securely store your API keys as environment variables in Netlify.

## Step 5: Test the Production Deployment

We'll verify that everything works correctly with the real Binance API.
